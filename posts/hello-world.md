# Hello world

This is a tets for the blog that I want to create.

```sh
touch index.js
```

Then you can open it with your favorite code editor\
I will be using visual studio code but you can use one that you really like

```sh
code index.js
```

If you are in linux and you want to use a default one run

```sh
vim index.js
```
